#download latest version of Java JDK here:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

#if you just need to run java from VScode, you only need to place the content 
#of the extracted tarball in for ex. /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-15 like so:
tar -zxf [downloaded file] -C /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-15

#if you also need to run from command line:
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/JDKit/jdk-13.0.2/bin/java" 1010
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/opt/JDKit/jdk-13.0.2/bin/javac" 1010

#now java -version works

# setting priority is only needed if other versions of java exists:
sudo update-alternatives --config java
